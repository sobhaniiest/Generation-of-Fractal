# Generation-of-Fractal

The original fractal tree is generated using fixed length of the seed line segment, fixed rotation, etc.

Here the approach is generation of different variations of the Fractal tree by changing different parameters of generation - angle between branches, selection of branches etc, particularly using random numbers.
